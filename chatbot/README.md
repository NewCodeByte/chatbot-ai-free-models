### General
*   **Database:** Uses SQLite 3 for all data storage (settings, styles, messages, admin users).

    *   The admin panel and login page are translatable using `gettext`.
    *   Language preference is stored in the database.
    *   Requires `.po` and `.mo` files in the `/languages` directory.
*   **Security:**
    *   Admin authentication with password hashing (PASSWORD_DEFAULT).
    *   Output escaping (`htmlspecialchars`) to prevent XSS.
    *   MIME type and file size validation for uploads.
    *   DOMPurify for sanitizing Markdown-rendered HTML from bot messages.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** PHP (7.x or higher recommended)
*   **Database:** SQLite 3
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
*   **AI Provider:** [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
*   **External JS Libraries (CDN):**
    *   [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) (for Markdown parsing)
    *   [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) (for HTML sanitization)

## Prerequisites

*   A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
*   PHP version 7.0 or newer.
*   PHP extensions:
    *   `sqlite3`
    *   `session`
    *   `json`
    *   `fileinfo`
    *   `mbstring`
    *   `gettext` (for internationalization)
*   Write permissions for the web server on the chatbot's root directory (for `db.db` creation) and the `images/`, `sounds/` subdirectories.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Download/Clone:**
    *   Download the latest release or clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/NewCodeByte/chatbot-ai-free-models/
        ```
    *   Place the `chatbot` folder into your web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/chatbot` or `htdocs/chatbot`).

2.  **Permissions:**
    *   Ensure your web server has write permissions for the main chatbot directory (to create/write to `db.db`).
    *   Ensure your web server has write permissions for the `images/` and `sounds/` subdirectories if you plan to upload custom assets.
        ```bash
        # Example (adjust user/group as needed, e.g., www-data)
        # sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your/chatbot
        sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/chatbot
        sudo chmod 664 /path/to/your/chatbot/db.db  # If it exists, or parent dir writeable
        sudo chmod 775 /path/to/your/chatbot/images
        sudo chmod 775 /path/to/your/chatbot/sounds
        ```
    *   The `db.db` file will be created automatically when you first access `login.php` or `admin.php`.

3.  **Admin Setup:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your-domain.com/path-to-chatbot/login.php`.
    *   If no admin user exists, you will be prompted to create one. Follow the on-screen instructions.
    *   Once created, log in with your new admin credentials.

4.  **Configure Settings:**
    *   In the admin panel, navigate to the "Settings" tab.
    *   Enter your **OpenRouter.ai API Key**. You can get one from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).
    *   Select an AI model (free models are available).
    *   Fill in the "Knowledge Base" and "Bot Rules" to customize your chatbot's behavior and information source.
    *   Configure other settings as needed (chat title, welcome message, etc.).

5.  **Internationalization (Optional):**
    *   The application uses `gettext` for translations.
    *   Translation files (`.po`, `.mo`) should be placed in the `/languages/{locale_code}/LC_MESSAGES/` directory. For example, for US English: `/languages/en_US.UTF-8/LC_MESSAGES/chatbot.mo`.
    *   The text domain is `chatbot`.
    *   You can use a tool like Poedit to create/edit `.po` files and compile them to `.mo` files.
    *   Supported languages by default (can be extended): English, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese.

## Embedding the Chatbot

To add the chatbot to any page on your website:

1.  Include the following JavaScript snippet in your HTML, preferably before the closing `</body>` tag:

    ```html
    <script src="/path-to-chatbot/embed.js" defer></script>
    ```

2.  **Important:** Replace `/path-to-chatbot/` with the actual URL path where you installed the chatbot files on your server.
    *   For example, if the chatbot is in `https://example.com/my-chatbot/`, the script src would be `/my-chatbot/embed.js`.
    *   If it's in the root, it might be `/embed.js`.

3.  The `embed.js` script will automatically create the chat button and the iframe-based chat window on the page. It uses the settings and styles configured in the admin panel.

## Configuration

Most configuration is done through the **Admin Panel**. Key settings include:

*   **API Key & Model:** Essential for the AI to function.
*   **Knowledge Base:** The core information your bot will use.
*   **Bot Rules:** How your bot should behave and respond.
*   **Styling:** Customize the look and feel.
*   **Language:** Set the admin panel and default chatbot language.
